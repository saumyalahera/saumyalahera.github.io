      "description": "3D models are, essentially, a collection of 3D coordinates called vertices. They are connected together to make triangles. Each vertex can contain few other informations, such as a colour, the direction it points towards (called normal) and some coordinates to map textures onto it (called UV data). 3D models have a material and material has shaders. Models cannot be rendered without a material. Materials are wrappers which contain a shader and the values for its properties. Hence, different materials can share the same shader, feeding it with different data. Model->Material->Shader. Shader functions run on the GPU. Vertex Functions - Are used to play with vertex positions. For instance, animating an object. Fragment Functions - Are used to change pixel colors. Kernel Functions - Are used in Machine Learning and Kernel shaders are used for that.",
